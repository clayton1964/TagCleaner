# Tag Cleaner

## About
Have you ever needed to totally erase/remove ALL tags from your sound files? What about correcting non-compliant sound files. 
There are many apps out there that 'butcher' sound files when adding metadata to them. 
This includes adding the wrong type of metadata frames to the files.

This plugin's aim is to perform different types of 'cleaning' on your files. This can be simply checking for compliance to
established standards, all the way to removing EVERY possible piece of metadata leaving you with pure sound data and nothing else.
